        <div class="about-intro">
            <p>We're a passionate group of Northwestern students who believe that healthcare should be accessible to everyone in our community. Since 2019, we've been working directly with Chinatown residents to break down language barriers and connect families with the health resources they need most.</p>

                    <p>Every month, you'll find us at the Chinatown Community Center helping elderly residents fill out insurance forms, or at health fairs translating between doctors and patients. Last year alone, our volunteers logged over 800 hours helping bridge the gap between healthcare providers and our community.</p>

We've helped over 200 families navigate everything from Medicare enrollment to finding a Mandarin-speaking dentist in the area.</p>
