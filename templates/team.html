As someone who grew up often navigating the challenges of the U.S. healthcare system, alongside her family, when she started learning about the different opportunities that exist to contribute to efforts that support community health systems, she was especially interested to explore this more. The reality is, while the care we have access to is of critical importance, the process for seeking such care and even preventative measure matters as much. This looks like in having access to food, housing, and a community with green spaces. It also looks like having access to information about one's health and having such information available in a language accessible to one too. Contributing to CTHI's efforts, especially through the Health Education Committee, made her really excited to join. The work communities do on a local level is meaningful for increasing access. Kimberly enjoys going to cafes, reading, making music playlists, and trying to master her family's recipes.</p>
